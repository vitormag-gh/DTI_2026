## 🔍 Overview

Drug–target interaction (DTI) prediction plays a central role in computational drug discovery by prioritizing compounds for experimental validation.  
This project introduces an **integrated three-stage framework** that combines:

1. **Matrix Factorization (MSCMF, NNMF, LMF)** for latent representation learning  
2. **Generative Modeling (VAE, WGAN-GP)** for minority-class augmentation  
3. **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)** for final interaction prediction  

The method addresses major challenges in DTI prediction, including **data sparsity**, **class imbalance**, and **heterogeneous molecular representations**.

</p>

### 1. **Latent Representation Learning**
We compute drug and protein latent features using:
- **MSCMF** (Multiple Similarity Collaborative Matrix Factorization)  
- **NNMF** (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization)  
- **LMF** (Logistic Matrix Factorization)

MSCMF integrates structural and sequence similarity matrices to create a biologically meaningful latent space.

### 2. **Generative Augmentation**

We train two types of generators to augment minority-class interactions:

#### ⭐ **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**  
- Smooth latent reconstructions  
- Performs best on enzyme and GPCR families  

#### ⭐ **Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)**  
- Most effective in sparse regimes  
- Enhances recall for ion channels and nuclear receptors  

Augmentation is applied **only on the training split**, ensuring no leakage into validation or test sets.

### 3. **Deep Neural Network (DNN) Classifier**

The final classifier receives both real and synthetic samples.  
It is a lightweight architecture with:

- Latent feature concatenation  
- Dense layers with dropout  
- Sigmoid output for binary prediction  

All evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC) are reported for each of the four Yamanishi families.

---

## 📊 Results Summary

Our framework consistently outperforms existing baseline methods (SPCA, Random Forests) across all ligand families.  
Key findings:

- **WGAN-GP** improves recall in sparse families  
- **VAE** performs robustly in larger families  
- **MSCMF + WGAN-GP** provides the most stable overall performance  
- ROC-AUC often exceeds **0.99** in all protein families
